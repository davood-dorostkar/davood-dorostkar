ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m davood-dorostkar.

I love intelligent systems. Why? I believe that humans have done the 3 D's enough already: 'Dull, Dangerous, Dirty' tasks; intelligent systems can tackle those tasks and disburden people of doing hard and tedious jobs. That intelligent system might be a robot, a mechatronics device, an autonomous car, an autonomous mobile robot, or a web software service, to name a few.

I think of intelligent agents as 'Systems' comprised of different subsystems working together in a logical way. I am really interested in understanding the interconnection of subsystems; hence, it paved the way for me to deliberately dive into these topics to grow my proficiency in the whole system:

### Hardware & Electronics:
- 4 years of experience implementing electronics and embedded systems, developing solutions with both embedded boards and microcontrollers.
- Experienced in hardware implementation and have working knowledge in a wide range of sensors and embedded systems.

### Software:
- Developed both computer software and embedded software based on C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. 
- Worked for 2 years making full stack web software with Django and VanillaJS; utilized AJAX technology to develop RESTful APIs and responsive web applications.

### Dynamics & Robotics:
- Coded and simulated manipulators and other robotic systems.
- A top scorer in the 'Advanced Dynamics', 'Advanced robot control', and 'ROS & Gazebo' courses.

### Other:
- Worked for 1 year within an agile and self-organized team focused on fast delivery. I was captivated by Scrum and felt like I have found what I really needed.
- Also Familiar with computer vision, machine learning, and CI/CD.

### My Skills: 
Robotics,
Control,
ROS,
Embedded systems,
C/C++,
Python,
JavaScript,
Django,
Docker,
Git

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning continous integration practices with CircleCI.
