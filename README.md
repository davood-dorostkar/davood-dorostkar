ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Davood Dorostkar.

I am passionate about intelligent systems because I believe they can relieve humans of the 3 D's: "Dull, Dangerous, and Dirty" tasks. Whether it's a robot, mechatronics device, autonomous car, mobile robot, or web software service, intelligent systems have the potential to tackle hard and tedious jobs and improve our lives.

To me, intelligent systems are more than just machines. They are complex systems comprised of different subsystems working together in a logical manner. I am fascinated by the interconnection of these subsystems and have made a deliberate effort to deepen my understanding of the entire system. This has allowed me to grow my proficiency and develop a holistic perspective on the topic.

### Software:
- Developed both computer software and embedded software based on C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. 
- fascinated by Object-Oriented Programming, Clean Coding, TDD, Design Patterns
- Worked for 2 years making full stack web software with Django and VanillaJS; utilized AJAX technology to develop RESTful APIs and responsive web applications.

### Hardware & Electronics:
- 4 years of experience implementing electronics and embedded systems, developing solutions with both embedded boards and microcontrollers.
- Experienced in hardware implementation and have working knowledge in a wide range of sensors and embedded systems.

### Dynamics & Robotics:
- Coded and simulated manipulators and other robotic systems.
- A top scorer in the 'Advanced Dynamics', 'Advanced robot control', and 'ROS & Gazebo' courses.

### Other:
- Worked for 1 year within an agile and self-organized team focused on fast delivery. I was captivated by Scrum and felt like I have found what I really needed.
- Also Familiar with computer vision, machine learning, and CI/CD.

### My Skills:
